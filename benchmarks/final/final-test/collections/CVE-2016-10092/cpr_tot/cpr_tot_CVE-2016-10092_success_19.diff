+/* Rationale:
+   This minimal change clamps the pointer advance to at most 'stripsize'. If TIFFReadEncodedStrip
+   returned a larger-than-expected byte count (which could cause a one-byte or larger
+   out-of-bounds write), this emits a TIFFError (via the comma operator) and uses 'stripsize'
+   instead of the oversized value. This prevents advancing bufp past the expected strip
+   allocation and avoids the out-of-bounds write. This patch is distinct from other variants
+   by performing an explicit clamp against 'stripsize' and issuing an error when the read
+   exceeds the strip size.
